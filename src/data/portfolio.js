To reflect their ideologies and message of spreading art throughout the community, I designed and developed a responsive website that breaks the grid as much as it creates it.</p><br><p>The site was built from scratch and made to fit responsively on any device. It was designed to look clean and modern, but also take inspiration from the more \"do it yourself\" and experimental qualities that their events and artists hold. The brighter colors of the site and the elements that are placed outside of what would be normal in other modern sites help the design appeal to these more artistic individuals and younger audience who would be drawn to their events.</p>",

Through gathering information from students within the Department and learning more about what prohibits them from coming to the design club meetings and working together with both upper and underclassman, we realized we need to give them an easily accessible place to come together and discuss important aspects of the department. Which led us to design the Department of Design application.</p><br><p>This application takes four important aspects that we discovered in our research and gives them each a section for students within the Department to discuss and use to build a stronger community. Those sections include communication, critiquing, planning, and personal identity. By taking these concepts and giving students an easily accessable platform to discuss these topics, we expect an actively used community that creates dialogue and awareness throughout the Department.</p><br><p>To learn more about this project and the process of creating this concept, feel free to see the full presentation on <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/58814409/DOD-A-Community\" target=\"_blank\">Behance</a>.</p>",

By using the IPhone X's enhanced AR capabilities, I was to design the user interface and experience for an application to help users find their friends and keep in track with them, no matter where they were. This led to the creation of Locus.</p><br><p>By moving the phone around in a 3D space, you would be able to see where your friends are in your group by taking advantage of the simplistic compass that moves you in the direction of where your friends are currently. You are also given the capabilities to ping your group to come to you or ping, call, and text individual friends by selecting their pin on the compass. When you select your friends, you will also be given a map of where they are and their most recent status update to let you friends know where and what you are doing.</p><br><p>To learn more about this project and the process of designing this interface, feel free to see the full presentation on <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/59657299/Locus-the-App-Finding-your-Friends-through-AR\" target=\"_blank\">Behance</a>.</p>",
