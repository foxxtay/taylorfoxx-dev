				<h1>Dear Union,</h1>
				<p>Hello! My name is Taylor Foxx and I am an Interactive Media Designer and Web Developer living in Fort Mill, SC. I am writing this to apply for the Jr. - Mid. Full Stack Developer Position. I love the work that your studio has created and the way you as a studio have branded yourselves. As a studio, your portfolio shows close attention to detail and modern aspects of design across a multitude of mediums that makes me excited to join your team. Looking at your site alone, it's obvious that your studio cares about giving clients a very unique and abstract experience from what you come to expect.</p><br />
				<p>Identifying this and looking at the exciting work your studio creates, I feel as though I have a lot to bring forward in my experience if we were to work together, while also being able to challenge myself and develop stronger skills with these new technologies. Looking at the requirements for this position, I do see a lot that I have worked in before, but I also know I have places I can grow in as well. I'd like to see myself become a part of the creative process and learn among your team of developers as we tackle these big projects. Your studio works in many mediums, which is exciting to see that there is always something new that could be around the corner. And I appreciate the way your studio emphasizes that working with clients is also developing a partnership with them to help each other grow.</p><br />
				<p>As a developer, what makes me most excited is being able to tell a story, not only in content but through the layout and interactive elements that we can create. It's not always the biggest elements that make a site, but simply the smallest details that can turn a static site into something bigger. I love to see new things that can be achieved in development and frameworks like WebGL that really push the expectation of people coming to a site. Much of the work I have done has been very static sites, however, when given the chance to work on something new, I do enjoy the process of learning and seeing the limitations of that system. The industry is ever-changing, which can make development seem overwhelming at times, but also exciting because there is always something new that couldn't have been done before.</p><br />
				<p>In the future of web development, I believe automation is going to get bigger than it already is in other fields. We build sites all the time that already use the same layouts, so it would make sense that at some point there may be a system that is able to create that surface-level mark-up without us being a part of it. For us, I believe we are going to continue pushing the limits of what is possible in front-end development. We're able to create full systems, compact apps, and much more using Javascript alone, with new frameworks popping up almost daily. There's always going to be something new that will take everything we thought was possible before and give us an entirely new perspective on our limitations. It makes working with technology both scary, but insanely exciting to think about what's just around the corner.</p><br />
				<p>Thank you for reading this and I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p><br />
				<p>- Taylor</p>
